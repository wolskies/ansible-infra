# Service Configuration Replication Strategy
replication_strategy:
  priority_order:
    - "Install base services (nginx, apache, docker, etc.)"
    - "Deploy main configuration files"
    - "Deploy site/application specific configs"
    - "Deploy custom systemd services"
    - "Configure security services (fail2ban, firewall)"
    - "Start and enable services"
    - "Verify service health"

  manual_tasks_required:
    - "Review and customize configuration templates"
    - "Update domain names and IP addresses in configs"
    - "Configure SSL certificates"
    - "Set up service-specific secrets and credentials"
    - "Test service functionality after deployment"
    - "Configure monitoring and logging"

# Notes for Manual Configuration
# 1. Service configuration files have been detected but content needs review
# 2. Custom applications may require additional setup beyond configuration files
# 3. Database services may need schema and data migration
# 4. Web services may need SSL/TLS certificate configuration
# 5. Always test services in a staging environment first
