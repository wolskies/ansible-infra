# Package Discovery - Standard Ansible variable names
# These can be used directly with roles that support these variables
          
# Discovered packages as system packages (basic infrastructure)
# Note: Discovery cannot determine package categories, so all discovered packages
# are classified as system packages. Users can reorganize as needed.

# NOTES:
# - These variables represent the essential configuration of localhost
# - Use these with any roles that support standard Ansible variable names
# - Package lists are ready to use with package management roles  
# - Discovery focuses only on what basic_setup role can replicate
# - AUR packages (Arch) and Homebrew packages (macOS) are categorized separately
