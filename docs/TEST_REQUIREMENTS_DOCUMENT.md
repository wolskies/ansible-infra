## Document Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive test strategy, requirements, and coverage for the wolskies.infrastructure collection v1.2.0. It establishes the testing methodology to validate all requirements specified in the Software Requirements Document (SRD) v1.0.

---

## 1. Test Strategy Overview

### 1.1 Test Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- **Individual role tests are authoritative** - Each role must have comprehensive tests that validate its specific functionality
- **No test-specific production code** - Never add `when: not molecule_test` conditionals or similar test accommodations to production code
- **Semantic failures over masking** - Let roles fail properly rather than masking issues with test workarounds
- **Progressive testing approach** - Each test phase should catch issues before the next phase

**Testing Contract:**
> Individual role tests are the definitive validation of functionality. If role tests pass but integration fails, this indicates missing role test coverage, not integration code issues.

### 1.2 Test Hierarchy

**Phase I: Development Testing (Required before any commit)**
1. `ansible-lint` - Syntax and standards validation
2. `molecule converge` - Role functionality testing during development
3. `molecule test` - **MUST PASS** - Full test suite including verification
4. `pre-commit` - Formatting, linting, custom hooks

**Phase II: CI Testing (Automated)**
- Individual role tests (parallel execution)
- Integration testing
- Discovery validation
- Minimal scenario testing

**Phase III: VM Testing (Comprehensive validation)**
- Full platform matrix testing
- Real-world scenario validation
- Edge case testing
- Performance validation

### 1.3 Test Types by Role Complexity

**Simple Roles** â†’ Individual role tests (`roles/{role-name}/molecule/default/`)
- Focus: Role-specific functionality, packages, configuration
- Examples: nodejs, rust, go, os_configuration, manage_packages

**Orchestrating Roles** â†’ Integration tests (`molecule/test-integration/`)
- Focus: Role interactions, cross-dependencies, end-to-end workflows
- Examples: configure_system (calls multiple roles)

**Cross-cutting Concerns** â†’ Specialized test suites
- Discovery validation
- Security hardening verification
- Platform compatibility

**Setup Validation**:
```bash
cd roles/{role-name}
molecule converge  # Must work without errors
molecule test     # Must pass completely
```

### 4.2 CI Environment

**TEST-REQ-008**: CI environment SHALL provide isolated, reproducible test execution

**Requirements**:
- Ubuntu latest runners with Docker support
- Parallel job execution capability
- Ansible and molecule pre-installed
- Collection dependency management

      - rust
      - go
      - neovim
      - terminal_config

- Cloud image support (Ubuntu, Arch)
- SSH key-based access as `ed` user

**VM Configuration Matrix**:
```yaml
vm_targets:
  ubuntu2204:
    image: "jammy-server-cloudimg-amd64.img"
    os_family: "Debian"
  ubuntu2404:
    image: "noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img"

```

---

## 5. Test Execution

### 5.1 Local Development Workflow

**Standard Development Testing**:
```bash
# 1. Syntax and standards validation
ansible-lint

# 2. Role functionality testing
cd roles/{role-name}
molecule converge

# 3. Full test suite (REQUIRED before commit)
molecule test

# 4. Pre-commit validation
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Critical Rule**: `molecule test` failure = commit blocked

### 5.2 CI Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1: Parallel Role Testing**
```yaml
jobs:
  test-roles:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        role: [nodejs, rust, go, neovim, terminal_config]
    steps:
      - name: Test individual role
        run: cd roles/${{ matrix.role }} && molecule test
```

**Stage 2: Integration Testing**
```yaml
jobs:
  test-integration:
    needs: test-roles
    steps:
      - name: Test role interactions
        run: cd molecule/test-integration && molecule test
```

**Stage 3: Discovery & Validation**
```yaml
jobs:
  test-discovery:
    needs: test-roles
    steps:
      - name: Test discovery validation
        run: cd molecule/test-discovery && molecule test
```

### 5.3 VM Test Procedures

**Phase I: Infrastructure Provisioning**
```bash
# 1. VM creation with OpenTofu
cd vm-test-infrastructure/phase1-local-linux/terraform
tofu apply -auto-approve

# 2. Connectivity validation
ansible all -i inventory.ini -m ping
```

**Phase II: System Configuration**
```bash
# 3. Full system deployment
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini \
  configure_system.yml \
  --extra-vars "@test-scenarios/comprehensive-test.yml"
```

**Phase III: Validation**
```bash
# 4. Discovery and validation
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini \
  validate_vm_configuration.yml \
  --extra-vars "@test-scenarios/comprehensive-test.yml"
```

**Validation Strategy**: Compare discovery playbook results against expected configuration inputs to ensure:
- All users created with correct properties
- All packages installed and functional
- All services enabled and running
- All firewall rules applied correctly
- All security hardening measures active

### 5.4 Test Data Management

**Test Scenarios**:
- `confidence-test.yml` - Basic functionality validation
- `comprehensive-test.yml` - Full feature testing with edge cases
- `minimal-test.yml` - Minimal configuration testing
- `edge-case-test.yml` - Boundary and error condition testing

**Expected Results Storage**:
- VM validation results: `/tmp/validation_results_*.yml`
- Test artifacts preserved for 7 days
- Failed test logs captured and stored

### 5.5 Performance and Quality Metrics

**Performance Targets**:
- Individual role tests: < 5 minutes each
- Integration tests: < 10 minutes
- Full CI pipeline: < 15 minutes
